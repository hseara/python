    "Python is currently the programming language of choice for many scientists. This is why:\n",
    "- It is straightforward to learn\n",
    "- It is effortless to read\n",
    "- Quick prototyping\n",
    "- It offers plenty of libraries (no need to reinvent the wheel).\n",
    "- It provides the power to analyze and model scientific data (Good scientific libraries, no need to reinvent the wheel).\n",
    "- The standard de facto language for machine learning.\n",
    "- Not restricted to Science, you can do virtually everything with it.\n",

    "This is no longer a valid question. Python 2 is finally discontined as 1st of January 2020. If you need further information about the issue please check the following [post](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).\n",

    "There were for a long time two branches of current releases in Python: the older-syntax Python 2, and the newer-syntax Python 3. This schizophrenia is largely intentional: when it became clear that some non-backwards-compatible changes to the language were necessary, the Python dev-team decided to go through a five-year (or so) transition, during which the new language features would be introduced and the old language was still actively maintained, to make such a transition as easy as possible. We're now (2020) only Python 3 should be used. Therefore this is what we will use in the course."
