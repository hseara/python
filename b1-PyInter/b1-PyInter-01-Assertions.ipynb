    "# Assertions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised. Assertions are carried out by the assert statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output."

    "## The `assert` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When it encounters an `assert` statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises an `AssertionError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for assert is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "assert Expression[, Arguments]\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the `AssertionError`. `AssertionError` exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception using the `try-except` statement, but if not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback."
