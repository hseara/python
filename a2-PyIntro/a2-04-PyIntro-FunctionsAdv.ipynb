    "## Functional programming\n",
    "Functional programming is a very broad subject. The idea is to have a series of functions, each of which generates a new data structure from an input, without changing the input structure at all. By not modifying the input structure (something that is called not having *side effects*), many guarantees can be made about how independent the processes are, which can help parallelization and guarantees of program accuracy. There is a [Python Functional Programming HOWTO](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/functional.html) in the standard docs that goes into more details on functional programming. I just wanted to touch on a few of the most important ideas here.\n",
