    "# Serialization: Save it for later\n",
    "*Serialization* refers to the process of outputting data (and occasionally functions) to a database or a regular file, for the purpose of using it later on. In the very early days of programming languages, this was normally done in regular text files. Python is excellent at text processing, and you probably already know enough to get started with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing large amounts of data became important, people developed database software based around the Structured Query Language (SQL) standard. I'm not going to cover SQL here, but, if you're interested, I recommend using the [sqlite3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) module in the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data interchange became important, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has emerged. XML makes data formats that are easy to write parsers for, greatly simplifying the ambiguity that sometimes arises in the process. Again, I'm not going to cover XML here, but if you're interested in learning more, look into [Element Trees](http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html), now part of the Python standard library."
