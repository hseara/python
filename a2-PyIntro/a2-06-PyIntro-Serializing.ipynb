    "# Serialization: Save it for later\n",
    "*Serialization* refers to the process of outputting data (and occasionally functions) to a database or a regular file, for the purpose of using it later on. In the very early days of programming languages, this was normally done in regular text files. Python is excellent at text processing, and you probably already know enough to get started with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing large amounts of data became important, people developed database software based around the Structured Query Language (SQL) standard. I'm not going to cover SQL here, but, if you're interested, I recommend using the [sqlite3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) module in the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data interchange became important, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has emerged. XML makes data formats that are easy to write parsers for, greatly simplifying the ambiguity that sometimes arises in the process. Again, I'm not going to cover XML here, but if you're interested in learning more, look into [Element Trees](http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html), now part of the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a very general serialization format called **pickle** that can turn any Python object, even a function or a class, into a representation that can be written to a file and read in later. But, again, I'm not going to talk about this, since I rarely use it myself. Again, [the standard library documentation for pickle](http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#module-cPickle) is the place to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I am going to talk about is a relatively recent format call [JavaScript Object Notation](http://json.org/) (JSON) that has become very popular over the past few years. [There's a module in the standard library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) for encoding and decoding JSON formats. The reason I like JSON so much is that it looks almost like Python, so that, unlike the other options, you can look at your data and edit it, use it in another program, etc.\n",
