    "## Blocks\n",
    "A **code block** is a piece of Python program text that can be executed as a unit, such as a module, a class definition or a function body. Some code blocks (like modules) are normally executed only once, others (like function bodies) may be executed many times. **Code blocks** may textually contain other code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Almost) every programming language defines blocks of code in some way. In Fortran, one uses END statements (ENDDO, ENDIF, etc.) to define code blocks. In C, C++, and Perl, one uses curly braces {} to define these blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python uses a colon (\":\"), followed by indentation level to define code blocks**. Everything at a higher level of indentation is taken to be in the same block. In the above example the block was only a single line, but we could have had longer blocks as well:"
