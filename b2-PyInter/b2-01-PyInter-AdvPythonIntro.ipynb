    "> \"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"\n",

    "The second rule of speeding up your code is to only do it if you really think you need to do it. Python has two tools to help with this process: a timing program called **timeit**, and a very good code profiler. We will discuss both of these tools in this section, as well as techniques to use to speed up your code once you know it's too slow."

Recall that some time ago we wrote a factorial routine, but also pointed out that Python had its own routine built into the math module. Is there any difference in the speed of the two? `timeit` helps us determine this. For example, `timeit` tells how long each method takes:"

    "the factorial function we wrote is about a factor of 10 slower. This is because the built-in factorial function is written in C code and called from Python, and the version we wrote is written in plain old Python. A Python program has a lot of stuff in it that make it nice to interact with, but all that friendliness slows down the code. In contrast, the C code is less friendly but more efficient. If you want speed with as little effort as possible, write your code in an easy to program language like Python, but dump the slow parts into a faster language like C, and call it from Python. We'll go through some tricks to do this in this section."

    "## Other Ways to Speed Python\n",
    "When we compared the fact and factorial functions, above, we noted that C routines are often faster because they're more streamlined. Once we've determined that one routine is a bottleneck for the performance of a program, we can replace it with a faster version by writing it in C. This is called *extending* Python, and there's a [good section in the standard documents](http://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html). This can be a tedious process if you have many different routines to convert. Fortunately, there are several other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Swig](http://swig.org/) (the simplified wrapper and interface generator) is a method to generate binding not only for Python but also for Matlab, Perl, Ruby, and other scripting languages. Swig can scan the header files of a C project and generate Python binding for it. Using Swig is substantially easier than writing the routines in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cython](http://www.cython.org/) is a C-extension language. You can start by compiling a Python routine into a shared object libraries that can be imported into faster versions of the routines. You can then add additional static typing and make other restrictions to further speed the code. Cython is generally easier than using Swig.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyPy](http://pypy.org/) is the easiest way of obtaining fast code. PyPy compiles Python to a subset of the Python language called RPython that can be efficiently compiled and optimized. Over a wide range of tests, PyPy is [roughly 6 times faster than the standard Python Distribution](http://speed.pypy.org/)."
